 * into the embedded worker Blob string. Because the package build runs with
 * `build.sourcemap: true`, Vite appends the worker's sourcemap reference to the inlined
 * worker source before embedding it as a string literal (escaped `\n//# …\n`). A blob
 * URL can't resolve that sibling `.map`, so the comment is pure dead weight — and the
 * from-source harness build (`sourcemap: "hidden"`) emits none, so stripping it keeps
 * the inlined worker byte-aligned with a from-source build. Runs on the MAIN build,
 * where the blob string lives; `enforce: "post"` so it sees final chunk code (and, for
 * dist, runs after esbuild minification which leaves string contents untouched). Vite
 * may also emit an orphan worker `*.js.map` asset for the inlined worker even though
 * no sibling worker `*.js` file is written; prune those orphan maps so dist contains
 * only maps that correspond to emitted JS files.
